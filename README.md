## Create XP Style Buttons


</div>

### Description

Here's a nice way to create XP Style Buttons. This literally will just take minutes to change the look of your .exe. Just simply follow the instructions and you'll be quite happy with the result. Note: You have to be on an XP machine for this to work. Visualicious is probably an even better alternative here at PSC, But doing it this way with Reshacker is kind of fun.. and the program is quite interesting...
